Using OnLine tool, Github and Dropbox
for publishing...Here are some notes for myself

From web (github site) to create/edit files
on my local host, do 'git pull'

From local host to create/edit files
git add newFile
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/sheauyen/Myprojects/xxx
git push -u origin master
